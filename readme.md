# Spam Email Classification
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). The model utilizes text data from emails and applies various machine learning algorithms to accurately categorize them.

## Problem Statement
Spam emails are a significant issue in today's digital world. They clog inboxes, waste time, and can even pose security threats through phishing attacks. An effective spam classification system can automatically filter out unwanted emails, improving user experience and protecting against potential risks.

## Importance of the Project
Efficiency: Automating the spam detection process saves time and effort for users, allowing them to focus on important emails.

### Security: 
Identifying and filtering out malicious emails can prevent phishing and other cyber threats.
Productivity: Reducing the number of spam emails in an inbox helps users manage their communications more effectively.

### Scalability: 
A robust spam detection system can be scaled to handle large volumes 
of email traffic, making it suitable for both individual users and large organizations.

### Project Features
Data Preprocessing:
Clean and prepare email text data for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from email content using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
Model Training: Train various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Neural Networks) on labeled email data.

### Evaluation:
 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Deploy the model using a web-based application with a Flask backend for real-time spam classification.
